## Description
This module focused on navigating through a JSON dataset in order to view the bacteria found in individuals' belly buttons that partook in this experiment. A URL previously given was used in order to parse through the json and successfully extract desired information by using the D3 library. A bar chart and bubble graph were made in order to view the top bacteria of any chosen individual, as well as a Demographics tab successfully updates the speciic information of that individual.

Code was written using Plotly, HTML, CSS, D3 library, and JavaScript
